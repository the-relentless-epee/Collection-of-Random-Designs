this is a tripod phone mound designed for quick attach/detach. It uses a rotating cam to clamp the phone. Compared to designs that use a screw clamp, this is much quicker to attach/detach; compared to designs that use rubber band to quickly attach phones, this is more secure, making it more suitable for more aggresive camera movements.

# Hardware Required:
- 1/4 inch heat set insert (for tripod screw)
- M4 heat set insert (for mounting cam)
